-  Hi, I’m @Richardsaeed
- My interests revolve around Space!.. More specificially, galaxy formation, planetary nebulae, and tidal disruption events. Although there's significantly more I am interested in!
- I’m currently learning python and data science- both play a significant role in the realm of Astrophysics- making sense of data plays a monumental role in understanding the nature of the Universe.
- I’m looking to collaborate on stellar and planetary transits, spectroscopy from stars, and much much more.
- You can reach me at richardjs@berkeley.edu
