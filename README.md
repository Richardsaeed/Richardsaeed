- 👋 Hi, I’m @Richardsaeed
- 👀 I’m interested in ... Space!.. More specificially, galaxy formation and planetary nebulae. Although there's significantly more I'm interested in cosmology!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... Python and data science- both play a significant role in the realm of Astrophysics- making sense is monumental in science!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... stellar and planetary transits, spectroscopy from stars, and much much more.
- 📫 How to reach me ... You can reach me at Richardjs@berkeley.edu
